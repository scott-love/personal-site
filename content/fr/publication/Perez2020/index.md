abstract: "Avoidance of novelty, termed neophobia, protects animals from potential dangers but can also impair their adaptation to novel environments or food resources. This behaviour is particularly well described in birds but the neurobiological correlates remain unexplored. Here, we measured neuronal activity in the amygdala and the striatum, two brain regions believed to be involved in novelty detection, by labelling the early gene c-fos following chicks exposure to a novel food (NF), a novel object (NO) or a familiar food (FF). NF and NO chicks showed significantly longer latencies to touch the food, less time eating and emitted more fear-vocalizations than control chicks. Latency to touch the food was also longer for NO than for NF chicks. Significantly higher densities of c-fos positive cells were present in all the nuclei of the arcopallium/amygdala of NF and NO chicks compared to FF chicks. Also, NO chicks showed higher positive cell densities than NF chicks in the posterior amygdaloid, the intermediate and the medial arcopallium. Exposure to novel food or object induced a similar increase in c-fos expression in the nucleus accumbens and the medial striatum. Our data provide evidence activation of the arcopallium/amygdala is specific of the type of novelty. The activation of striatum may be more related to novelty seeking."
