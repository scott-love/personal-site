A quick(ish) tutorial on how I setup my personal but work related [website](https://scott-love.github.io) using Git(Hub), Hugo and Academic on a Mac. This is a fairly *simple* and completely *free* way to host an academic personal website. The process came from two main sources: 1. The [documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/) for Academic and; 2. A blog post by [George Cushen](https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/).

## So what did I do:

* I already had [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and you will need it too.

* Then install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/). There are several options but I used the Tarball method. Full details can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) but here is a brief description.
  1. Chose install location (e.g., /usr/local/bin), in your executable PATH.
  2. Download the latest [Tarball](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) for your system to the Downloads folder.
  3. Install Hugo in your chosen location.
  ```
  cd /usr/local/bin # CHOSEN_INSTALL_LOCATION
  # extract the tarball
  tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/hugo_X.Y_osx-64bit.tgz
  # verify that it runs
  ./hugo version
  ```

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [Academic Kickstart](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart#fork-destination-box) repository to your GitHub account.
 1. Login to your GitHub account.
 2. Click [here](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart#fork-destination-box) or search for sourcethemes/academic-kickstart inside GitHub.
 3. Click on the fork icon towards the top right of the screen.
<br/><br/>
* [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) the repository onto your local system. Note that you need to change \<USERNAME\> to your GitHub username and that My_Website can be changed to any name you want.
```
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
```

* Initialise the theme.
```
cd My_Website
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* Create your GitHub website repository.
  1. On your GitHub page click the “+” icon in the top right corner and choose “New Repository”.
  2. Repository name = \<USERNAME\>.github.io.
<br/><br/>
* Add your \<USERNAME\>.github.io repository into a submodule folder named public.
```
git submodule add https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git public
```

* [Add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) to the local git repository then [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) to the remote repository.
```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```

* Run Hugo to create the HTML for the site.
```
hugo server
```

* View the built site in your browser (http://localhost:1313/) but note this is only a local copy and not visible to others.

* Upload the built site to Github for everyone to see @ \<USERNAME\>.github.io. Note it will take 2 or 3 minutes to be viewable.
```
git add .
git commit -m "build website"
git push -u origin master
```

## Adding content:
OK, the website is built it's time to add content. You can make additions/changes to your website and check out the results before deploying to your actual site.

A good place to start is the config.toml file in the main directory of your site.
It contains a bunch of key-value pairs. change the title value to the title of your website, e.g., your name. Then run Hugo server to create the HTML for the site.
```
hugo server
```
View the local copy of the built site in your browser (http://localhost:1313/).
Leave the server running and any other changes you make will be automatically visible in local site just created. Go through all the key-value pairs and change, edit or remove any that you want.

## Github version control:
The [Host on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#github-user-or-organization-pages) page from Hugo outlines a nice way to store all the files of your site on GitHub.

## Updating the website content:
Using the GitHub method above I do not keep a local copy of any of the files. Here is the process I follow to update the website content.
```
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<YOUR-PROJECT>
cd <YOUR-PROJECT>/
git rm -r public
```
At this point you can make changes to the content of your website and push those to the remote repository.

```

```

## Update academic-kickstart version:
I have found updating the academic-kickstart version and subsequently the website to be very complicated!
